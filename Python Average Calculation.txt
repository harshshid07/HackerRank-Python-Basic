# WRITE PYTHON CODE TO CALCULATE AVERAGE OF 'n' Numbers
# Implement 'avg' to define it's function
# The result must contain a 'float' value as the average

# Code Starts From Here:

def avg(numbers):
    return float(sum(numbers)) / len(numbers) if len(numbers) > 0 else 0.0

average = avg(numbers)
print("Average:", average)
